Files allow us to work with data, without needing to enter it each time our program
runs. Files also allow us to store results from our program in a more permanent manner. These features are often used when creating larger programs. When completing
the exercises in this chapter, you should expect to:

- Open a file for reading and/or writing
- Read data from a file
- Write data to a new file
- Use values provided to the program as command line parameters
- Detect and recover from errors such as attempting to open a file that doesnâ€™t exist
- Detect and recover from other errors that are not specifically related to files
