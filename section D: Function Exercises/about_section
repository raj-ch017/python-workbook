Functions allow a programmer to break a problem into pieces that can be reused.
They can also help a programmer focus on one part a larger problem at a time. As
a result, writing functions is often an important part of developing larger pieces of
software. The exercises in this chapter will help you practice these skills:

- Define a function for later use
- Pass one or more values into a function
- Perform a complex calculation within a function
- Return one or more results from a function
- Call a function that you have defined previously
