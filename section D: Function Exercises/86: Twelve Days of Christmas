Exercise 86: The Twelve Days of Christmas

The Twelve Days of Christmas is a repetitive song that describes an increasingly long list 
of gifts sent to one's true love on each of 12 days. A single gift is sent on the first day.
A new gift is added to the collection on each additional day, and then the complete collection
is sent. The first three verses of the song are shown below:

    On the first day of Christmas:
    my true love sent to me:
    A partridge on a tree

    On the second day of Christmas:
    my true love sent to me:
    Two turtle doves,
    And a patridge on a tree

    On the third day of Christmas:
    my true love sent to me:
    Three French hens,
    Two turtle doves,
    And a partridge on a tree

Your task is to write a program that displays the complete complete lyrics for Twelve Days of 
Christmas. Write a function that takes the verse number as it's only parameter and displays
the specified verse of the song. Then call that function 12 times with integers increasing
from 1 to 12.

Each item that is sent to the recipient in the song should only appear once in your program,
with the possible expection of partridge. It may appear twice if that helps you handle 
the difference between "A partridge in a pear tree" in the first verse and "And a partridge
in a pear tree" in the subsequent verses. Import your solution to Exercise 85 to help you
complete this exercise.
