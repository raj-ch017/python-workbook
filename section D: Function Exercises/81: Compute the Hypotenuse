Exercise 81: Compute the Hypotenuse

Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as its
parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean Theorem, as
the function's result. Include a main program that reads the lengths of shorter sides of a
right triangle from the userm uses your function to compute the length of the hypotenuse 
and display the reuslt.
