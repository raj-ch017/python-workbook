"""
Exercise 90: Does a String Represent an Integer?

In this exerise, you will write a function named isInteger that determinse whether or not 
the characters in a string represent a valid integer. When determining if a string represents 
an integer you should ignore any leading or trailing white space. Once this white space is 
ignored, a string represents an integer if its length is at least 1 and it only contains digits,
or if its first character is either + or - and the first character is followed by one or more
characters, all of which are digits.

Write a main program that reads a stirng from the user and reports whether or not it represents 
an integer. Ensure that the main program will not run if the file containing your solution is
imported into another program.
