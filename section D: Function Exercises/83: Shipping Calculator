Exercise 83: Shipping Calculator

As online retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate of $10.95
for the first item, and $2.95 for each subsequent item. Write a function that takes the
number of items in the order as it's only parameter. Return the shipping charge for the 
order as the function's result. Include a main program that reads the number of items 
purchased from the user and displays the shipping charge.

"""

items = int(input("Enter the number of items in your order: "))

def shipping_charge(items):
    extra_items = items - 1
    cost = 10.95 + (extra_items * 2.95)
    return cost

total = shipping_charge(items)

print("Your total shipping charges: ${}".format(round(total,2)))
