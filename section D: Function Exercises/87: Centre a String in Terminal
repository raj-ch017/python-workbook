Exercise 87: Centre a String in the Terminal

Write a function that takes a string of characters as its first parameter, and the width of
the terminal as its second parameter. Your function should return a new string that consists
of the original string and the correct number of leading spaces so that the original string 
will appear centered within the provided width when it is printed. Do not add any characters
to the end of the string. Include a main program that demonstrates your function.
