Exercise 94: Random Password

Write a function that generates a random password. The password should have a random length of
between 7 and 10 characters. Each character should be randomly selected from positions 33 to
126 in ASCII table. Your function will not take any parameters. It will return the randomly
generated password as its only result.
Display the randomly generated password in your file's main program.
