"""
Exercise 91: Operator Precedence

Write a function named precedence that returns an integer representing the precedence of a 
mathematical operator. A string containing the operator will be passed to the function as its
only parameter. Your function should return 1 for + and -, 2 for * and /, 3 for (^).
If the string passed to the function is not one of these operators then the function should 
return (-1). Include a main program that reads an operator from the user and either displays
the operator's precedence or an error message indicating that the input was not an operator.
Your main program should only run when the file containing your solution has not been imported
into another program.
