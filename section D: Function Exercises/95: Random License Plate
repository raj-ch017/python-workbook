Exercise 95: Random License Plate

In a particular jurisdiction, older license plate must consist of three letters followed by
three numbers. When all of the license plates following that pattern had been used, the format
was changed to four numbers followed by three letters.

Write a function that generates a random license plate. Your function should have approximately equal odds of generating a sequence of characters for an old license plate or 
a new license plate. Write a main program that calls your function and displays the randomly
generated license plate.
