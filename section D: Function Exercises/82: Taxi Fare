Exercise 82: Taxi Fare

In a particular jurisdiction, taxi fares consist of a base fare of $4.00, plus $0.25 for every
140m travelled. Write a functoin that takes the distance traveled (in kilometers) as it's only
parameter and returns the total fare as it's only result. Write a main program that
demonstrates the function.
