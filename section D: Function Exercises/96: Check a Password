"""
Exercise 96: Check a Password

In this exercise you will write a function that determines whether or not a password is good.
We will define a good password to be a one that is at least 8 characters long and contains
at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter and at least one number. 

Your function should return true if the password passed to it as it's only parameter is good.
Otherwise it should return false. Include a main program that reads a password from the user
and reports whether or not it is good.
