Exercise 85: Convert an Integer to it's Ordinal Number

Words like first, second and third are referred to as ordinal numbers. In this exercise, 
you will write a function that takes an integer as it's only parameter and returns a string
containing the appropriate English ordinal number as its only result. Your function must handle
the integers between 1 and 12 (inclusive). It should return an empty string if a value outside
this range is provided as a parameter. Include a main program that demonstrates your function 
by displaying each integer from 1 to 12 and it's ordinal number. Your main program should only
run when your file has not been imported into another program.
