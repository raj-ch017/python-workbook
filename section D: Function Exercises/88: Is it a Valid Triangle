Exercise 88: Is it a Valid Triangle?

If you have 3 straws, possibly of differing lengths, it may or may not be possible to lay them down so that they form a triangle when their ends are touching. For example, if all of 
the straws have a length of 6 inches, then one can easily construct an equilateral triangle 
using them. However, if one straw is 6 inches long, while the other two are each only 2 inches
long, then a trinagle cannot be formed. In general, if any one length is greater than or equal
to the sum of the other two then the lengths cannot be used to form a triangle. Otherwise,
they can form a triangle.

Write a function that determines whether or not three lengths can form a triangle. The
function will take 3 parameters and return a Boolean result. In addition, write a function
that reads 3 lengths from the user and demonstrates the behaviour of this function.
