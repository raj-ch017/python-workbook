Exercise 97: Random Good Password

Using your solutions to Exercise 94 and 96, write a program that regenerates a random good
password and displays it. Count and display the number of attempts that were needed before 
a good password was generated. Structure your solution so that it imports the functions 
you wrote previously and then calls them from a function named main in the file that you 
create for this exercise.
