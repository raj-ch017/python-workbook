# Exercise 130: Text Messaging

"""
On some basic cell phones, text messages can be sent 
using the numeric keypad. Because each key has multiple
letters associated with it, multiple key presses are 
needed for most letters. Pressing the number once
generates the first letter on the key. Pressing
the number 2, 3, 4 or 5 times generates the second, 
third, fourth or fifth character listed for that key.

    ---------------------------------
        Key     |     Symbols
    ---------------------------------
        1       |     .,?!:
        2.      |.    ABC
   
   
Write a program that displays the key presses that 
must be made to enter a text message read from the 
user. Construct a dictionary that maps from each
letter or symbol to the key presses. Then use the
dictionary to generate and display the presses for 
the user's message. 

For example, if the user enters 'Hello, World!', then
your program should output:

    4433555555666110966677755531111
    
Ensure your program handles both uppercase and lower-
case letters. Ignore any characters that aren't listed
in the table above such as semicolons and brackets.
