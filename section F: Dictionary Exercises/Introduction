"""
Dictionaries are another data structure that Python
programmers can use to manage larger amount of data.
While many of the exercises in this chapter can be 
solved with lists or if statements, most (or even all)
of them have solutions that are well suited to dictionaries.

As a result, you should use dictionaries to solve all
of the exercises instead of (or in addition to) using
the constructs that you have been introduced to in the
previous chapters. Completing the exercises in this
chapter will help you learn:

    * Create a new variable that holds a dictionary
    * Add a key-value pair to a dictionary
    * Update the value associated with a key in a
    dictionary
    * Iterate over all of the keys and/or values in
    a dictionary
    * Write functions that take dictionaries as parameters
