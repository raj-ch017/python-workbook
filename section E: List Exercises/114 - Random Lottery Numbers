# Exercise 114: Random Lottery Numbers

"""
In order to win the top prize in a particular lottery,
one must match all 6 numbers on his or her ticket to
the 6 numbers between 1 and 49 that are drawn by the
lottery organizer. Write a program that generates a 
random selection of 6 numbers for a lottery ticket.

Ensure that the 6 numbers selected do not contain 
any duplicates. Display the numbers in ascending order.
