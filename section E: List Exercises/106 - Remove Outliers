# Exercise 106: Remove Outliers

"""
When analysis data collected as a part of science
experiment it may be desirable to remove the most
extreme values before performing other calculations.

Write a function that takes a list of values and an
non-negative integer (n) as it's parameters.

The function should create a new copy of the list with
the (n) largest elements and the (n) smallest elements
removed. Then it should return the new copy of the list
as the function's only result. 
The order of the elements in the returned list does not
have to match the order of the elements in the 
original list.

Write a main program that demonstrates your function.
Your function should read a list of numbers from the
user and remove the two largest and two smallest values
from it. Display the list with the outliers removed,
followed by the original list.
Your program should generate an appropriate error
message if the user enters less than 4 values.
