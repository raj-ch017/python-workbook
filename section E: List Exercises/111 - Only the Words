# Exercise 111: Only the Words

"""
In this exercise you will create a program that identifies
all of the words in a string entered by the user.

Begin by writing a function that takes a string of text
as its only parameter. Your function should return a 
list of words in the string with the punctuation marks
at the edges of the words removed.

The punctuation marks that you must remove include 
commas, periods, question marks, hyphens, apostrophes,
exclamation points, colons and semicolons. Do not
remove punctuation marks that appear in the middle of 
words, such as the apostrophes used to form a 
contraction. 

For example, if your function is provided with the 
string 'Examples of contractions include: don't, isn't,
and wouldn't.' then your function should return the
list ["Examples", "of","contractions", "include",
    "don't", "isn't", "and", "wouldn't"].
    
    
    
Write a main program that demonstrates your function.
It should read a string from the user and display all
of the words in the string with the punctuation marks
removed. You will need to import your solution to 
this exercise when completing exercise 158. As a result,
you should ensure that your main program only runs
when your file has not been imported into another
program.
