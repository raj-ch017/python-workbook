# Exercise 107: Avoiding Duplicates

"""
In this exercise, you will create a program that reads
words from the user until the user enters a blank
line. After the user enters a blank line your
program should display each word entered by the user
exactly once. The words should be displayed in the
same order that they were entered. For example,
if the user enters:
    
    first 
    second
    first
    third
    second
    
then your program should display:

    first
    second
    third
