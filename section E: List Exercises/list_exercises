List Exercises

Lists help programmers manage larger amounts of data by
allowing several (or even many) values to be stored in
one variable.

This makes it practical to solve larger problems that
involve many data values. To solve the exercises in
this chapter you should expect to:

* Create a variable that holds a list of values
* Modifly a list by appending, inserting, updating
    and deleting elements
* Search a list for a value
* Display some or all of the values in a list
* Write a function that takes a list as a parameter
* Write a function that returns a list as its result
