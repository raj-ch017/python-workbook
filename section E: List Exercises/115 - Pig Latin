# Exercise 115: Pig Latin

"""
Pig Latin is a language constructed by transforming 
English words. While the origins of the language are 
unknown, it is mentioned in at least two documents
from the nineteenth century, suggesting that it has
existed for more than 100 years. The following rules
are used to translate English into Pig Latin:

    * If the word begins with a consonant (including y)
    then all letters at the beginning of the word, up
    to the first vowel (excluding y) are removed and 
    then added to the end of the word, followed by
    (ay). For example: 'computer' becomes 'omputercay'
    and 'think' becomes 'inkthay'
    
    * If the word begins with a vowel (not including y),
    then way is added to the end of the word. For example,
    'algorithm' becomes 'algorithmway' and 'office' becomes
    'officeway'
    
Write a program that reads a line of text from the user.
Then your program should translate the line into
Pig Latin and display the result. You may assume that
the string entered by the user only contains lowercase
letters and spaces.
