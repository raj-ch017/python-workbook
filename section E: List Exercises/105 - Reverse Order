# Exercise 105: Reverse Order

"""
Write a program that reads integers from the user and 
stores them in a list. Use 0 as sentinel value to mark
the end of the input.
Once all of the values have been read your program
should display them (except for the 0) in reverse order
with one value appearing on each line.
