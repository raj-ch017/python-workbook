# Exercise 108: Negatives, Zeros and Positives

"""
Create a program that reads integers from the user
until a blank line is entered.

Once all of the integers have been read, your program
should display all of the negative numbers, followed
by all of the zeros, followed by all of the positive
numbers.

Within each group the numbers should be displayed in
the same order that they were entered by the user.

For example, if the user enters the values:

    3, -4, 1, 0, -1, 0 and -2 
    
Then your program should output the values:

    -4, -1, -2, 0, 0, 3 and 1
    
Your program should display each value on it's own
line.
