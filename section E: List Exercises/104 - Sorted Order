# Exercise 104: Sorted Order


"""
Write a program that reads integers from the user and
stores them in a list. Your program should continue 
reading values until the user enters 0.
Then it should display all of the values entered by
the user (except for the 0) in order from smallest to 
largest, with one value appearing on each line.
Use either sort method or the sorted function to sort
the list.
