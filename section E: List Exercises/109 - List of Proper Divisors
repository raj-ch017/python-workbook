# Exercise 109: List of Proper Divisors

"""
A proper divisor of a positive integer (n) is a positive
integer less than (n) which divides evenly into n.

Write a function that computes all of the proper
divisors of a positive integer. The integer will be
passed to the function as it's only parameter.

The function will return a list containing all of the
proper divisors as its only result. Complete this 
exercise by writing a main program that demonstrates 
the function by reading a value from the user and 
displaying the list of its proper divisors. Ensure 
that your main program only runs when your solution has 
not been imported into another file.
