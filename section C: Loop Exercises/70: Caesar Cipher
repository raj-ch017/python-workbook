Exercise 70: Caesar Cipher

One of the first known examples of encryption was used by Julius Caesar. Caesar needed to
provide written instructions to his generals, but he didn't want his enemies to learn his
plans if the message slipped into their hands. As a result, he developed what later became
known as Caesar Cipher.

The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as a result, it provides no protection against 
modern code breaking techniques). Each letter in the original message is shifted by 3 places.
As a result, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', 'C' becomes 'F', etc. The last three letters 
in the alphabet are wrapped around to the beginning: 'X' becomes 'A', 'Y' becomes 'B' and
'Z' becomes 'C'. Non-letter characters are not modified by the cipher.

Write a program that implements a Caesar Cipher. Allow the user to supply the message and the
shift amount, and then display the shifted message. Ensure that your program encodes both 
uppercase and lowercase letters. Your program should also support negative shift values so 
that it can be used to both encode and decode messages.
