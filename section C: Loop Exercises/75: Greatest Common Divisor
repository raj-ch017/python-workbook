Exercise 75: Greatest Common Divisor

The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, (n) and (m), is the largest number, (d)
which divides evenly both into (n) and (m). There are several algorithms that can be used
to solve this problem, including:

    Initialize (d) to the smaller of (m) and (n).
    While (d) does not evenly divide (m) or (d) does not evenly divide (n) do
        Decrease the value of (d) by 1
    Report (d) as the greatest common divisor of (n) and (m)

Write a program that reads two positive integers from the user and uses this algorithm
to determine and report their greatest common divisor.
