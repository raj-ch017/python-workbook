Exercise 77: Binary to Decimal 

Write a program that converts a binary (base 2) number to a decimal number (base 10). Your 
program should begin by reading the binary number from the user as a string. Then it should
compute the equivalent decimal number by processing each digit in the binary number. 
Finally, your program should display the equivalent decimal number with an appropriate message.

        place -= 1
