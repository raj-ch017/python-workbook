Exercise 78: Decimal to Binary

Write a program that converts a decimal (base 10) number to binary (base 2).

Read the decimal number from the user as an integer and then uses the division algorithm
shown below to perform the conversion. When the algorithm completes, result contains the 
binary representation of the number. Display the result, along with an appropriate message.

    Let result be an empty string.
    Let q represent the number to convert 
    repreat 
        Set r equal to the remainder when q is divided by 2
        Convert r to a string and add it to the beginning of result 
        Divide q by 2, discarding any remainder, and store the result back into q
    until q is 0
