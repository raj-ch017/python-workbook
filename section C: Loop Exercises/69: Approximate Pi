Exercise 69: Approximate pi

    pi approximately equals:

        3 + (4/2*3*4) - (4/4*5*6) + (4/6*7*8) - (4/8*9*10) + (4/10*11*12) .....

Write a program that displays 15 approximations of pi. The first approximation should make
use of only the first term from the infinite series. Each additional approximation displayed
by your program should include one more term in the series, making it a better approximation
of pi than any of the approximations displayed previously.
