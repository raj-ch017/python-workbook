Exercise 68: Parity Bits

A parity bit is a simple mechanism for detecting errors in data transmitted over an unreliable
connection such as a telephone line. The basic idea is that an additional bit is transmitted
after each group of 8 bits so that a single bit erorr in transmission can be detected.

Parity bits can be computed for either even parity or odd parity. If even parity is selected,
then the parity bit that is transmitted is chosen so that the total number of one bits 
transmitted (8 bits of data plus the parity bit) is even. When odd parity is selected, the
parity bit is chosen so that the total number of one bits transmitted is odd.

Write a program that computes the parity bit for groups of 8 bits entered by the user using
even parity. Your program should read strings containing 8 bits until the user enters a blank
line. After each string is entered by the user your program should display a clear message 
indicating whether the parity bit should be 0 or 1. Display an appropriate error message
if the user enters something other than 8 bits.
