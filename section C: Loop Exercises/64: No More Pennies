Exercise 64: No More Pennies

February 4, 2013 was the last day that pennies were distributed by the Royal Canadian Mint.
Now that pennies have been phased out, retailers must adjust totals os that they are multiples
of 5 cents when they are paid for with cash(credit card and debit card transactions continue
to be charged to penny.) While retailers have some freedom in how they do this, most choose
to round to the closest nickel.

Write a program that reads prices from the user until a blank line is entered. Display the 
total cost of all the entered items on one line, followed by the amount due if the customer
pays with cash on a second line. The amount due for a cash payment should be rounded to the 
nearest nickel. One way to compute the cash payment amount is to begin by determining how 
many pennies would be needed to pay the total. Then compute the remainder when this number of 
pennies is divided by 5. Finally, adjust the total down if the remainder is less than 2.5.
Otherwise adjust the total up.

user_pay = input("Payment method: ")
user_pay.lower()

user_in = input("Enter the price of your item: ")
total = float(user_in)

while (user_in != ""):
    user_in = (input("Enter the price of your item: "))
    if user_in == "":
        break
    total = total + float(user_in)

if user_pay == "cash":
    print("Total amount: ${}".format(total))
    pen_amt = total * 100
    remain = pen_amt % 5
    if remain < 2.5:
        print("Amount due: ${}".format(total - remain / 100))
    else:
        print("Amount due: ${}".format(total + 0.05 - remain/100))
else:
    print("Total amount due: ${}".format(total))
