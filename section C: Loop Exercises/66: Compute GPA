"""
Exercise 66: Compute a Grade Point Average

Exercise 51 included a table that shows the conversion from letter grade to grade points at 
a particular academic institute. In this exercise, you will compute the grade point average
of an arbitary number of letter grades entered by the user. The user will enter a blank line
to indicate that all of the grades have been provided.

For example, if user enters (A), followed by (C+), followed by (B), followed by a blank line
the your program should report a grade point average of 3.1.

You may find your solution to Exercise 51 helpful when completing this exercise.
Your program does not need to do any error checking. It can assume that each value entered
by the user will always be valid letter grade or a blank line.
