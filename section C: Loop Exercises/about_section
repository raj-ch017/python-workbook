The exercises that appear in this chapter should all be completed using loops. In some cases the exercise specifies what type of loop to use. 
In other cases you must make this decision yourself. Some of the exercises can be completed easily with both for loops and while loops. 
Other exercises are much better suited to one type of loop than the other. In addition, some of the exercises require multiple loops.
When multiple loops are involved, one loop might need to be nested inside the other. Carefully consider your choice of loops as you design your solution to each problem.
