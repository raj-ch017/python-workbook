Exercise 65: Compute the Perimeter of a Polygon

Write a program that computes the perimeter of a polygon. Begin by reading the x and y
values for the first point on the perimeter of the polygon from the user. Then continue
reading pairs of (x) and (y) values until the user enters a blank line for the x-coordinate.

Each time you read an additional coordinate you should compute the distance to the previous
point and add it to the perimeter. When a blank line is entered for the x-coordinate your
program should add the distance from the last point back to the first point to the perimeter.

Then it should display the total perimeter.
