Exercise 62: Discount Table

A particular retailer is having a 60% off sale on a variety of discontinued products. The retailer would like to help its customers determine the reduced price of the merchandise by having a printed discount table on the table that shows the original prices and the prices
after the discount has been applied. 

Write a program that uses a loop to generate this table, showing the original prices, the
discount amount, and the new price for purchases of $4.95, $9.95, $14.95, $19.95 and $24.95.
Ensure that the discount amounts and the new prices are rounded to 2 decimal places when they are displayed.
