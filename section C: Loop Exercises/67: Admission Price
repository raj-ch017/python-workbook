Exercise 67: Admission Price

A particular zoo determines the price of admission based on the age of the guest. Guests of 
2 years of age and less are admitted without a charge. Children between the age of 3 and 12
years of age cost $14.00. Seniors aged 65 years and above cost $18.00. Admission for all
other guests os $23.00.

Create a program that begins by reading the ages of all of the guests in a group from the user
with one age entered on each line. The user will enter a blank line to indicate that there
are no more guests in the group. Then your program should display the admission cost for the
group with an appropriate message. The cost should be displayed using two decimal places.
