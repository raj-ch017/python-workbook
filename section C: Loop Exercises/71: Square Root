Exercise 71: Square Root

Write a program that implements Newton's method to compute and display the square root of a 
number entered by the user. The algorithm for Newton's method is:

    Read (x) from the user
    Initialize guess to (x/2)
    While guess is not good enough do
        Update guess to be the average of guess and x/guess 

When this algorithm completes, guess contains an approximation of the square root. The 
quality of the approximation depends on how you define "good enough". In the solution,
guess was considered good enough when the absolute value of the difference between
guess * guess and x was less than or equal to 10^(-12).

user_in =  float(input("Enter the number whose square root you want to calculate: "))

guess = user_in / 2
count = 1

while (abs(guess ** 2 - user_in) > 10**(-12)):
    term2 = user_in / guess 
    guess = (guess + term2) / 2
    count += 1

print("The square root of {} is {}".format(user_in,guess))
print("{} steps required".format(count))
