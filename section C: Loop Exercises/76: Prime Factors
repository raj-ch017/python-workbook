Exercise 76: Prime Factors

The prime factorization of an integer (n), can be determined using the following steps:

    Intialize factor to two
    While factor is less than or equal to (n) do
        If (n) is evenly divisible by factor then
            Conclude that factor is a factor of (n)
            Divide (n) by factor using integer division
        Else
            Increase factor by one

Write a program that reads an integer from the user. If the value entered by the user is less
than 2, then your program should display an appropriate error message. Otherwise your program
should display the prime numbers that can be multiplied together to compute (n), with one
factor appearing on each line. For example:

    Enter an integer (2 or greater): 72
    The prime factors of 72 are:
        2
        2
        2
        3
        3
