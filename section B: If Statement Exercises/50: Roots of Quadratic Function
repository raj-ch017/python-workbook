Exercise 50: Roots of a Quadratic Function

A univariate quadratic function has the form f(x) = a(x**2) + bx + c, where (a),(b) and (c) are
constants, and (a) is non-zero. The roots of a quadratic function can be found by finding
the values of (x) that satisfy the quadratic equation equalling a value of 0. A quadratic 
equation function may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots. These roots can be computed using the
quadratic formula, shown below:

    root = ((-b) +- (b**2 - 4*a*c)**(0.5))/(2a)

The portion of the expression under the square root sign is called the discriminant. If the
discriminant is negative, then the quadratic equation does not have any real roots. If the 
discriminant is 0, then the equation has one real root. Otherwise the equation has two real roots,
and the expression must be evaluated twice, once using a plus sign, and once using a minus sign
when computing the numerator.

Write a program that computes the real roots of a quadratic function. Your program should begin
by prompting the user for the values of (a), (b) and (c). Then it should display a message
indicating the number of real roots, along with the values of the real roots (if any).
