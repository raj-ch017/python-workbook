Exercise 45: What color is that square?

Positions on a chess board are identified by a letter and a number. The letter identifies the
column while the number identifies the row.

Write a program that reads a position from the user. Use an if statement to determine if the 
column begins with a black square or a white square. Then use modular arithmetic to report the 
color of the square in that row. 

For example, if the user enters "a1" then your program should report that the square is black.
If the user enters "d5" then your program should report that the square is white. Your program
may assume that a valid position will always be entered. It does not need to perform any error
checking.
