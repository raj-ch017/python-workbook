Exercise 60: Roulette Payouts

A roulette wheel has 38 spaces on it. Of these spaces, 18 are black, 18 are red and 2 are 
green. The green spaces are numbered 0 and 00. The red spaces are numbered:

    1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34 and 36

The remaining integers between 1 and 36 are used to number the black spaces. 
Many different bets can be placed in roulette. We will only consider the following subset 
of them in this exercise:

    Single number (1 to 36, 0, or 00)
    Red versus Black 
    Odd versus Even (0 and 00 do not pay out for even)
    1 to 18 versus 19 to 36

Write a program that simulates a spin of a roulette wheel by using Python's random number
generator. Display the number that was selected and all of the bets that must be paid. 

For example, if 13 is selected then your program should display:

    The spin result in 13...
    Pay 13
    Pay Black
    Pay Odd
    Pay 1 to 18

If the simulation results in 0 or 00 then your program should display "Pay 0" or "Pay 00" 
without any further output.
