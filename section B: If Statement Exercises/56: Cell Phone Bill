Exercise 56: Cell Phone Bill

A particular cell phone plan includes 50 mins of air time and 50 text messages for $15 a month.
Each additional minute of air time costs $0.25, while additional text messages cost $0.15 each.
All cell phone bills include an additional charge to $0.44 to support 911 call centres,
and the entire bill (including 911 charge) is subject to 5% sales tax.

Write a program that reads the number of minutes and text messages used in a month from
the user. Display the base charge, additional minutes charge (if any), additional text
charge (if any), the 911 fee, tax and total bill amount. Only display the additional 
minute and text message charges if the user incurred costs in these categories. Ensure
that all of the charges are displayed using 2 decimal places.
