Exercise 41: Note to Frequency

The following table lists an octave of music notes, beginning with middle C, along with
their frequencies:

    Note            Frequency (Hz)

    C4                  261.63
    D4                  293.66
    E4                  329.63
    F4                  349.23
    G4                  392.00
    A4                  440.00
    B4                  493.88

Begin by writing a program that reads the name of a note from the user and displays the note's
frequency. Your program should support all of the notes listed previously.

Once you have your program working correctly for the notes listed previously, you should add
support for all of the notes from C0 to C8. While this could be done by adding many additional
cases to your if statement, such a solution is cumbersome, inelegant and unacceptable for the
purposes of this exercise. 
Instead, you should exploit the relationship between notes in adjacent octaves. In particular,
the frequency of any note in octave (n) is half the frequency of the corresponding note in 
octave (n+1). 
By using this relationship, you should be able to add support for the additional notes without adding additional cases to your if statement.
