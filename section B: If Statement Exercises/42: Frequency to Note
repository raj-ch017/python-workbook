Exercise 42: Frequency to Note

In the previous question, you converted from note name to frequency.
In this question, you will write a program that reversed that 
process. Begin by reading a frequency from the user. If the 
frequency is within one Hertz of a value listed in the table
in previous question then report the name of the note. Otherwise, report that the frequency
does not correspond to a known note. In this exercise, you only need to consider the notes 
listed in the table. There is no need to consider notes from other octaves.

 Note            Frequency (Hz)
