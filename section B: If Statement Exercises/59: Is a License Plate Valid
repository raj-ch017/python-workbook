Exercise 59: Is a License Plate Valid?

In a particular jurisdiction, older license plates consist of three uppercase letters followed
by three numbers. When all of the license plates following that pattern had been used, the
format was changed to four numbers following by three uppercase letters.

Write a program that begins by reading a string of characters from the user. Then your program
should display a message indicating whether the characters are valid for an older style 
license plate or a newer style license plate. Your program should display an appropriate 
message if the string entered by the user is not valid for either style of license plate.

Comment: The exercise belongs to "If statement" genre. Therefore, the solution is expected
to use only "if" statements and no iterative constructs.

However, that means hardcoding the solution by manually checking every character of the 
input string, which can be done, but would lead to a lengthy solution.

Hence, I used the looping construct to reduce the solution size.
