Exercise 58: Next Day

Write a program that reads a date from the user and computes its immediate successor. 
For example, if the user enters values that represent 2013-11-18 then your program should 
display a message indicating that the day immediately after 2013-11-18 is 2013-11-19.

If the user enters values that represent 2013-11-30 then the program should indicate that
the next day is 2013-12-01. If the user enters values that represent 2013-12-31 then the
program should indicate that the next day is 2014-01-01. The date will be entered in numeric
form with three seperate input statements, one for the year, one for the month, and one 
for the day. Ensure that your program works correctly for leap years.
