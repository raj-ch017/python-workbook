Exercise 44: Date to Holiday Name

Canada has three national holidays which fall on the same dates each year.

    Holiday             Date

    New Year's Day      Jan 1
    Canada Day          July 1
    Christmas Day       Dec 25

Write a program that reads a month and day from the user. If the month and day match one of 
the holidays listed previously then your program should display the holiday's name.
Otherwise your program should indicate that the entered month and day do not correspond
to a fixed-date holiday.
