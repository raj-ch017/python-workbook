Exercise 57: Is it a Leap Year?

Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for Earth to orbit the Sun is actually
slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years 
to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years. The rules for 
determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:

    Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.
    Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
    Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
    All other years are not leap years.

Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether
or not it is a leap year.

"""

user_in = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if user_in % 400 == 0:
    print("{} is a leap year.".format(user_in))

elif user_in % 100 == 0:
    print("{} is not a leap year".format(user_in))
else:
    if user_in % 4 == 0:
        print("{} is a leap year".format(user_in))
    else:
        print("{} is not a leap year.".format(user_in))
