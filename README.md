This book is designed to support and encourage hands-on learning about programming. It contains 174 exercises, spanning a variety of academic disciplines and everyday situations, which you can solve using only the material covered in most introductory Python programming courses. Each exercise that you complete will strengthen your understanding and enhance your ability to tackle subsequent programming challenges.

Section A: Introduction to Programming Exercises
</p>
</h2>

The exercises in this chapter are designed to help you develop your analysis skills by
providing you with the opportunity to practice breaking small problems down into
sequences of steps. In addition, completing these exercises will help you become
familiar with Python’s syntax. To complete each exercise you should expect to use
some or all of these Python features:

- Generate output with print statements
- Read input, including casting that input to the appropriate type
- Perform calculations involving integers and floating point numbers using Python operators like +, -, *, /, //, %, and **
- Call functions residing in the math module
- Control how output is displayed using format specifiers

Section B: If Statement Exercises
</p>
</h2>

The programming constructs that you used to solve the exercises in the previous
chapter will continue to be useful as you tackle these problems. In addition, the
exercises in this chapter will require you to use decision making constructs so that
your programs can handle a variety of different situations that might arise. You should
expect to use some or all of these Python features when completing these problems:

- Make a decision with an if statement
- Select one of two alternatives with an if-else statement
- Select from one of several alternatives by using an if-elif or if-elif-else statement
- Construct a complex condition for an if statement that includes the Boolean operators and, or and not
- Nest an if statement within the body of another if statement

<h2>

Section C: Loop Exercises
</p>
</h2>

The exercises that appear in this chapter should all be completed using loops. In
some cases the exercise specifies what type of loop to use. In other cases you must
make this decision yourself. Some of the exercises can be completed easily with
both for loops and while loops. Other exercises are much better suited to one
type of loop than the other. In addition, some of the exercises require multiple loops.
When multiple loops are involved, one loop might need to be nested inside the other.
Carefully consider your choice of loops as you design your solution to each problem.

Section D: Function Exercises
</p>
</h2>

Functions allow a programmer to break a problem into pieces that can be reused.
They can also help a programmer focus on one part a larger problem at a time. As
a result, writing functions is often an important part of developing larger pieces of
software. The exercises in this chapter will help you practice these skills:

- Define a function for later use
- Pass one or more values into a function
- Perform a complex calculation within a function
- Return one or more results from a function
- Call a function that you have defined previously

<h2>

Section E: List Exercises
</p>
</h2>

Lists help programmers manage larger amounts of data by allowing several (or even
many) values to be stored in one variable. This makes it practical to solve larger
problems that involve many data values. To solve the exercises in this chapter you
should expect to:

- Create a variable that holds a list of values
- Modify a list by appending, inserting, updating and deleting elements
- Search a list for a value
- Display some or all of the values in a list
- Write a function that takes a list as a parameter
- Write a function that returns a list as its result

<h2>

Section F: Dictionary Exercises
</p>
</h2>

Dictionaries are another data structure that Python programmers can use to manage
larger amounts of data. While many of the exercises in this chapter can be solved with
lists or if statements, most (or even all) of them have solutions that are well suited to
dictionaries. As a result, you should use dictionaries to solve all of these exercises
instead of (or in addition to) using the constructs that you have been introduced
to in the previous chapters. Completing the exercises in this chapter will help you
learn to:

- Create a new variable that holds a dictionary
- Add a key-value pair to a dictionary
- Update the value associated with a key in a dictionary
- Iterate over all of the keys and/or values in a dictionary
- Write functions that take dictionaries as parameters

Section G: File and Exception Exercises
</p>
</h2>

Files allow us to work with data, without needing to enter it each time our program
runs. Files also allow us to store results from our program in a more permanent manner. These features are often used when creating larger programs. When completing
the exercises in this chapter, you should expect to:

- Open a file for reading and/or writing
- Read data from a file
- Write data to a new file
- Use values provided to the program as command line parameters
- Detect and recover from errors such as attempting to open a file that doesn’t exist
- Detect and recover from other errors that are not specifically related to files

Section H: Recursion Exercises
</p>
</h2>

A recursive function is a function that calls itself. In this chapter, you will use
recursive functions to solve a variety of problems. The programs that you write will
help you learn to:

- Identify the base case(s) for a recursive function
- Identify the recursive case(s) for a recursive function
- Write a non-trivial recursive function
- Use a recursive function that you have written to solve a problem
