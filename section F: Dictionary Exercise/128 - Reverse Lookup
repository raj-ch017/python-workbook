# Exercise 128: Reverse Lookup

"""
Write a function named reverseLookup that finds all of
the keys in a dictionary that map to a specific value.
The function will take the dictionary and the value to
search for as its only parameters. It will return a
(possibly empty) list of keys from the dictionary that
map to the provided value.

Include a main program that demonstrates the reverseLookup
function as part of your solution to this exercise.
Your program should create a dictionary and then
show that the reverseLookup function works correctly
when it returns multiple keys, a single key, and no
keys. Ensure that your main program only runs when the
file containing the solution has not been imported 
into another program.
