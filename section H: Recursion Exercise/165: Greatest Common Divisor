# Exercise 165: Greatest Common Divisor

"""
Euclid was a Greek mathematician who lived approximately 2,300
years ago. His algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor
of two positive integers, a and b, is both effective and recursive.

It is outline below:

    If b is 0 then
        Return a
    
    Else
        Set c equal to the remainder when a is divided by b
        Return the greatest common divisor of b and c
        
Write a program that implements Euclid's algorithm and uses it to
determine the greatest common divisor of two integers entered by
the user.
