"""
A recursive function is a function that calls itself. In this 
chapter, you will use recursive functions to solve a variety of
problems. The programs that you write will help you learn to:

    * Identify the base case(s) for a recursive function
    * Identify the recursive case(s) for a recursive function
    * Write a non-trivial recursive function
    * Use a recursive function that you have written to solve 
      a problem
